I attended the 33rd Annual Kansas Association of Mappers (KAM) Conference in Manhattan, KS on October 16th-19th, 2018.

I gave the following presentation: [ Using GIS to Assist with the Maintenance of the Election Office Street File (ELVIS)](https://github.com/williamtrimble/williamtrimble.github.io/raw/master/_data/KAM%20ELVIS%20presentation.pdf)

The presentation was an overview of a project for the Shawnee County Election Office to QC their ELVIS data. I'll be working to modify this python script for use throughout Kansas.
