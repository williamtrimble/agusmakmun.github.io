I submitted two maps to the KAM map gallery at the 33rd Annual conference.

The first was a more stylized version of a road network response distance for the Shawnee Heights Fire Department.
I used a two tone color scheme (pink and green) that I had seen in another map by Jonah Adkins and wanted to try on something.

The second was a redo of a tax unit map for the Clerks Office. I tried out a four color scheme using gradient fills to create polygon
shading similar to the style of old maps in the early 1900s that I had seen while browsing for ideas. The number of polygons made using
unique colors for each difficult so it proved to be a good alternative.
